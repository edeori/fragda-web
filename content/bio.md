**Fragda** is a **Budapest, Hungary-based** band that blends the extremity of modern death metal, the precision of deathcore, and the atmosphere of black metal into a distinct, oppressive sound. Their music is defined by fractured rhythms, tremolo-picked dissonance, and orchestral, cinematic arrangements — often described by critics as a unique form of *blackcore*.

Custom-built seven-string baritone guitars in drop E tuning form the backbone of their sonic identity. Whammy-driven pitch shifts and dense, layered guitar tracks create a massive, overwhelming *wall of sound* that has become their hallmark.

The band’s lyrical themes are steeped in **Eastern European witchcraft**, folklore, and occult mysticism, forging a mythic persona as the *Eastern European lords of witchcraft*. Their visual and thematic universe reinforces this haunting, symbolic aesthetic.

Fragda’s members hail from respected acts in the Hungarian underground, bringing both experience and raw creative energy to their collective vision.

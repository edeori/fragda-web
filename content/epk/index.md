**Fragda** is a **Budapest, Hungary**-based band that conjures a suffocating hybrid of modern death metal, precise deathcore mechanics, and the haunted aura of black metal. Marked by fractured rhythms and cinematic arrangements, their music embodies a mythic, occult-laden atmosphere — a soundscape that has been dubbed *blackcore*, at once destructive and otherworldly.

## Extended bio
Fragda is an extreme metal band from Budapest, Hungary, formed in 2019. Launched as the studio vision of guitarist-composer Ferenczi Márton (“Moth”), the project soon grew into a full line-up with vocalist Knapp Oszkár, guitarists Fejér Tamás and Vincze Tamás, and drummer Halász Illés Árpád. Together they shape a sound at the fault line between modern death metal’s extremity, deathcore’s surgical precision, and black metal’s haunted atmosphere.

The members carry pedigrees from across the Hungarian underground: vocalist Oszkár Knapp co-founded metal act Insane and fronts Rivers Ablaze; guitarist-composer Márton “Moth” Ferenczi also plays guitar in Rivers Ablaze; drummer Illés Árpád Halász records and performs with From The Sky; and guitarist Tamás Vincze (aka V.T./Fenisulfr) previously handled bass in Aornos and plays in Nemere—connections that feed directly into Fragda’s blackened intensity. 

Fragda’s writing leans on fractured, syncopated rhythms, tremolo-picked dissonance, and orchestral, cinematic layers that amplify tension rather than soften it. Custom seven-string baritone guitars in drop E, pitch-shift dives, and dense multi-tracked harmonies build an overwhelming wall of sound—immersive, oppressive, sharply detailed. It’s a language the group and press alike have described as blackcore: equal parts visceral impact and widescreen drama. 

Lyrically and visually, the band draws on Eastern European witchcraft, folk horror, and occult symbolism, reframing regional myth into a modern, ritualistic narrative. On stage they favor momentum over ornament—tight cues, stark dynamics, and a set that moves like a single arc. For listeners of Lorna Shore, Anaal Nathrakh, Der Weg einer Freiheit, Vildhjarta, or Humanity’s Last Breath, Fragda offers a distinctly Central-European take: colder, earthier, and resolutely cinematic.

On April 6, Fragda unveils *Glorification of Witchery*, a full-length album that channels the ancient forces of Eastern European witchcraft through a bold fusion of black metal, modern death metal, and cinematic soundscapes. This is not just an album— it’s a ritual invocation, merging raw aggression with theatrical atmospheres and hypnotic intensity.

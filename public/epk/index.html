Custom-built seven-string baritone guitars in drop E tuning form the backbone of their sonic identity. Whammy-driven pitch shifts and dense, layered guitar tracks create a massive, overwhelming wall of sound that has become their hallmark.">

        <p><strong>Fragda</strong> is a <strong>Budapest, Hungary-based</strong> band that blends the extremity of modern death metal, the precision of deathcore, and the atmosphere of black metal into a distinct, oppressive sound. Their music is defined by fractured rhythms, tremolo-picked dissonance, and orchestral, cinematic arrangements — often described by critics as a unique form of <em>blackcore</em>.</p>

<p>Custom-built seven-string baritone guitars in drop E tuning form the backbone of their sonic identity. Whammy-driven pitch shifts and dense, layered guitar tracks create a massive, overwhelming <em>wall of sound</em> that has become their hallmark.</p>
<p>The band’s lyrical themes are steeped in <strong>Eastern European witchcraft</strong>, folklore, and occult mysticism, forging a mythic persona as the <em>Eastern European lords of witchcraft</em>. Their visual and thematic universe reinforces this haunting, symbolic aesthetic.</p>
<p>Fragda’s members hail from respected acts in the Hungarian underground, bringing both experience and raw creative energy to their collective vision.</p>
<h2 id="line-up">Line-up</h2>

<li><strong>Knapp Oszkár</strong> – vocals</li>
<li><strong>Ferenczi ‘Moth’ Márton</strong> – guitar</li>
